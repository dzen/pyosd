	* pyosd.py 1.4: oops, forgot to update the module docstring

	* README 1.3: updated to reflect new API and version number.

	* _pyosd.c 1.4:
	* fixed a nasty bug which cropped up when readline was being used in the
	  interactive interpreter. SIGINT is now blocked in the xosd library.

	* pyosd.py 1.3:
	* added defaults for the remaining args to __init__. who knows why i did not do
	  it earlier.

	* README 1.2:
	* oops. the different line should read "fixed", not the same as the original.

	* README 1.1: New file.

	* pyosd.py 1.2: * got rid of some trailing spaces in the source file.

	* pyosd.py 1.1: New file.

	* _pyosd.c 1.3:
	* added a bunch of set methods so that everything except lines can be changed
	on the fly now

	* most functions pass around a xosd * now instead of using a global one. this
	allows a bunch of different class instances to display different stuff at once
